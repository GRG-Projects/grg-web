Many methods have been developed touse dMRI data to model the local configuration of white matter nerve fiberbundles and infer the trajectory of bundles connecting different parts of thebrain.Dipy gathers implementations of many different methods in dMRI, including:diffusion signal pre-processing; reconstruction of diffusion distributions inindividual voxels; fiber tractography and fiber track post-processing, analysisand visualization. Dipy aims to provide transparent implementations forall the different steps of dMRI analysis with a uniform programming interface.We have implemented classical signal reconstruction techniques, such as thediffusion tensor model and deterministic fiber tractography. In addition,cutting edge novel reconstruction techniques are implemented, such asconstrained spherical deconvolution and diffusion spectrum imaging withdeconvolution, as well as methods for probabilistic tracking and originalmethods for tractography clustering. Many additional utility functions areprovided to calculate various statistics, informative visualizations, as wellas file-handling routines to assist in the development and use of noveltechniques.In contrast to many other scientific software projects, Dipy is not beingdeveloped by a single research group. Rather, it is an open project thatencourages contributions from any scientist/developer through GitHub and opendiscussions on the project mailing list. Consequently, Dipy today has aninternational team of contributors, spanning seven different academic institutionsin five countries and three continents, which is still growing.} }"

title = "Ph.D Thesis : Towards an accurate brain tractography"
authors = "Eleftherios Garyfallidis"
abstract = "The objective of this thesis is to improve on the methods for inferring neu- ral tracts from diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI). Accordingly, I present improvements to the reconstruction, integration, segmentation and registration modalities of dMRI analysis. I compare and evaluate different Cartesian-grid q-space dMRI acqui- sition schemes, using methods based on the Fourier transform of the dif- fusion signal, with reconstructions by diffusion spectrum imaging or gen- eralised q-ball imaging methods. I propose a new reconstruction method called diffusion nabla imaging (DNI) which works with all these acqui- sition schemes, using an algorithm that directly approximates the orien- tation distribution function using the Laplacian of the signal in q-space. DNI has impressive accuracy on low angle crossings. Most previously published reconstruction methods are closely linked to their own specific track integration method. I have formulated a gen- eral, non-inferential, deterministic tractography algorithm (EuDX) which is based on Euler integration and trilinear interpolation, which works with voxel level information about fibre orientations including multiple cross- ings, and employs a range of stopping criteria. The purpose of this algo- rithm is to be faithful to the reconstruction results rather than try to correct or enhance them by introducing regional or global considerations. I have developed an entirely new, fully automatic, linear time, cluster- ing method (QuickBundles) which reduces massive tractographies to just a few bundles. These bundles are characterised by representative tracks which are multi-purpose and can be used for interaction with the data or as the basis for applying higher-complexity clustering methods which would have been impossible or too slow with the full data set. QuickBun- dles is currently the fastest known tractography clustering algorithm. After applying QuickBundles to tractographies from different subjects, I show how to use the representative tracks to identify robust landmarks within each subject which I use to directly register the different tractogra- phies together in a highly efficient way. The resulting correspondences provide important evidence for the anatomical plausibility of the derived bundles. I demonstrate how these methods can be used for group analy- sis, and for atlas creation. After applying QuickBundles to tractographies from different subjects, I show how to use the representative tracks to identify robust landmarks within each subject which I use to directly register the different tractogra- phies together in a highly efficient way.

This thesis contributes to the understanding of the diffusion signal in the context of dMRI acquisitions and builds on this foundation towards a more robust brain tractography which approximates more closely the underlying fibre architecture."

abstract = "Typical diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is susceptible to partial volume effects: different types of tissue that reside in the same voxel are inextricably mixed. For instance, in regions near the cerebral ventricles or parenchyma, fractional anisotropy (FA) from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) may be underestimated, due to partial volumes of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Free-water can be suppressed by adding parameters to diffusion MRI models. For example, the DTI model can be extended to separately take into account the contributions of tissue ..."

abstract = "Tractography based on non-invasive diffusion imaging is central to the study of human brain connectivity. To date, the approach has not been systematically validated in ground truth studies. Based on a simulated human brain data set with ground truth tracts, we organized an open international tractography challenge, which resulted in 96 distinct submissions from 20 research groups. Here, we report the encouraging finding that most state-of-the-art algorithms produce tractograms containing 90% of the ground truth bundles (to at least some extent). However, the same tractograms contain many more invalid than valid bundles, and half of these invalid bundles occur systematically across research groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate and confirm fundamental ambiguities inherent in tract reconstruction based on orientation information alone, which need to be considered when interpreting tractography and connectivity results. Our approach provides a novel framework for estimating reliability of tractography and encourages innovation to address its current limitations."

authors = "Shreyas Fadnavis , Marco Reisert , Hamza Farooq , Maryam Afzali , Cheng Hu , Bago Amirbekian , and Eleftherios Garyfallidis"
abstract = "MicroLearn is a Machine Learning and Model Fitting framework that enables modular construction of multi-compartment microstructure models in crossings with fast and accurate parameter estimation. Recent research attempting to probe the tissue microstructure using diffusion MRI (dMRI), has led to a variety of model fitting and machine learning based approaches to estimate the underlying model parameters accurately and quickly . Both kinds of approaches construct multicompartment models via combinations of intra- and extra- axonal spaces which are generally very hard to fit. MicroLearn aims at unifying these approaches with additional capabilities to interoperate between some state-of-the-art optimizers, machine learning methods and microstructure models. This framework is efficient in modeling regions of the brain with 0, 1, 2 and 3 fiber crossings alongside improved runtime performance and estimation accuracy. MicroLearn further helps underpin the mesostructure (macro-level tissue organization) features necessary for reconstruction using Supervised Bayesian Learning of the tissue microstructure. The framework will be made available as a part of DIPY with TensorFlow integrations to easily switch between the training strategies, optimization methods and advanced regression algorithms. This novel framework includes transparent implementation of various models with a superquadrics-based visualization."

abstract = "Tractography has created new horizons for researchers to study brain connectivity in vivo. However, tractography is an advanced and challenging method that has not been used so far for medical data analysis at a large scale in comparison to other traditional brain imaging methods. This work allows tractography to be used for large scale and high-quality medical analytics. BUndle ANalytics (BUAN) is a fast, robust, and flexible computational framework for real-world tractometric studies. BUAN combines tractography and anatomical information to analyze the challenging datasets and identifies significant group differences in specific locations of the white matter bundles. Additionally, BUAN takes the shape of the bundles into consideration for the analysis. BUAN compares the shapes of the bundles using a metric called bundle adjacency which calculates shape similarity between two given bundles. BUAN builds networks of bundle shape similarities that can be paramount for automating quality control. BUAN is freely available in DIPY. Results are presented using publicly available Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative data."

authors = "Bramsh Qamar Chandio & Eleftherios Garyfallidis"
abstract = "A brain pathway is digitally represented as a 3D line connecting an ordered sequence of 3D vector points called a streamline. Streamlines are generated by tractography methods applied on diffusion-weighted MRI. Direct alignment of white matter tractography/tracts is a crucial part of any diffusion MRI tractography based methods such as group analysis, tract segmentation, and tractometry analysis. In the past decade, several linear registration methods for streamline registration have been developed but the neuroimaging field still lacks robust methods for nonrigid streamline-based registration. In this paper, we introduce StND method for streamline-based partial-deformation registration. We formulate a registration problem for nonrigid registration of white matter tracts. In the StND, we first perform affine streamline-based linear registration (SLR) on white matter tracts and add a deformation step in it using the probabilistic non-rigid registration method called Coherent Point Drift. We model our collection of streamline data as a 3Dpoint-set data and apply high-level deformations to better align tracts."

abstract = "Brain atlases have proven to be valuable neuroscience tools for localizing regions of interest and performing statistical inferences on populations. Although many human brain atlases exist, most do not contain information about white matter structures, often neglecting them completely or labelling all white matter as a single homogenous substrate. While few white matter atlases do exist based on diffusion MRI fiber tractography, they are often limited to descriptions of white matter as spatially separate “regions” rather than as white matter “bundles” or fascicles, which are well-known to overlap throughout the brain. Additional limitations include small sample sizes, few white matter pathways, and the use of outdated diffusion models and techniques. Here, we present a new population-based collection of white matter atlases represented in both volumetric and surface coordinates in a standard space. These atlases are based on 2443 subjects, and include 216 white matter bundles derived from 6 different automated state-of-the-art tractography techniques. This atlas is freely available and will be a useful resource for parcellation and segmentation."

abstract = "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is the only non-invasive method for quantifying microstructure and reconstructing white-matter pathways in the living human brain. Fluctuations from multiple sources create significant noise in DWI data which must be suppressed before subsequent microstructure analysis. We introduce a self-supervised learning method for denoising DWI data, Patch2Self, which uses the entire volume to learn a full-rank locally linear denoiser for that volume. By taking advantage of the oversampled q-space of DWI data, Patch2Self can separate structure from noise without requiring an explicit model for either. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Patch2Self via quantitative and qualitative improvements in microstructure modeling, tracking (via fiber bundle coherency) and model estimation relative to other unsupervised methods on real and simulated data."
