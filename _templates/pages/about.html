        The Garyfallidis Research Group (GRG) was established on September 1,
        2016, by Dr. Eleftherios Garyfallidis. GRG specializes in cutting-edge
        research across multiple domains, including medical imaging, machine
        learning, signal processing, scientific visualization, and software
        engineering. The groupâ€™s primary focus is the development of innovative
        methods in these areas, particularly for the analysis of MRI data. This
        research has broad applications, such as mapping the brain's structural
        connectivity, as well as targeted uses in fields like Alzheimer's
        disease research and brain tumor tracking.
        <br />
        GRG also serves as the headquarters for DIPY, a renowned international
        software project dedicated to computational neuroanatomy. DIPY is widely
        recognized for its contributions to the field, offering advanced tools
        for understanding brain structure and function through imaging
        technologies.

          <strong>Dr. Eleftherios Garyfallidis</strong> holds the position of
          Associate Professor of Intelligent Systems Engineering (ISE) at
          Indiana University (IU) Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and
          Engineering. <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis works on the interface between machine learning,
          medical imaging and engineering visualization.
          <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis is a pioneer in the world of scientific open source
          software as he is a core member of the Neuroimaging in Python
          development team that revolutionized and democratized the way research
          is performed in Neuroscience. Other members of the team include
          Matthew Brett (nibabel), Gael Varoquaux (scikit-learn), Fernando Perez
          (jupyter), Stefan van der Walt (scikit-image), Satrajit Gosh (nipype)
          and Ariel Rokem (nitime). Dr. Garyfallidis was the youngest member of
          the team but he was instrumental to the success of Neuroimaging in
          Python by leading the Diffusion Imaging in Python (DIPY) project. One
          of the most challenging and research heavy projects in scientific
          software in the world. Prof. Garyfallidis is the inventor of multiple
          ground breaking algorithms including QuickBundles. QuickBundles was
          the first fast and unsupervised algorithm in neuroimaging for grouping
          tractographies using streamlines. Prof. Garyfallidis is the inventor
          of SLR. SLR is the most accurate method for affinely registering
          bundles or tractograms. Prof. Garyfallidis research has been
          foundational in understanding the challenges of brain tractography.
          Due to a method called RecoBundles, in 2015 Garyfallidis enabled the
          evaluation of tractographies in data with distortions. Until that day,
          no other method was able to solve this problem. This led to a
          publication in Nature Communications that evaluated the
          state-of-the-art in tractography research across many labs in the
          world.

          <br /><br />
          The pioneering work that Dr. Garyfallidis started and is today
          championed by his graduate students. See for example his labs work on
          Patch2Self denoising and Bundle Analytics. Prof. Garyfallidis is
          organizing yearly workshops (see DIPY workshops) to train faculty and
          students to use the latest methods in neuroimaging.
          <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis is the creator and lead of FURY. FURY was created
          to address this necessity of high-performance 3D scientific
          visualization in an easy-to-use API fully compatible with the Pythonic
          ecosystem and for heavy duty use (large and dynamic data). FURY uses
          OpenGL/Vulkan and enhances them using customized shaders. FURY
          provides access to the latest technologies such as raytracing, signed
          distance functionality, physically based rendering, and collision
          detection for direct use in research. More importantly, FURY enables
          students and researchers to script their own 3D animations in Python
          and simulate dynamic environments. Students and industrial partners
          can use FURY to showcase: optimization problems, machine learning
          algorithms, investigate different representations of the data and even
          create interactive games with skinning and morphing and physical
          simulations. FURY is driving scientific innovation. For example, it
          gave rise to Furious Atoms and Horizon projects.
          <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis is the director of the GRG research group at ISE
          specializing in the development of new methods and intelligent
          algorithms for medical imaging and brain mapping. In addition, the GRG
          creates general purpose machine learning algorithms that solve hard
          problems for a great range of domains. One of the most exciting
          projects is Thetan. Thetan is a new machine learning framework that
          outperforms the current state of the art in machine learning. The
          Thetan software is aimed to be released in Fall 2026. In addition, the
          GRG team is working on many areas in ML from improving optimization
          using topology to creating new neural networks and reinforcement
          learning methods to solve eminent signal processing problems.
          <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis has won multiple scientific challenges (IEEE) and
          his research is supported by multiple NIH and NSF grants. His target
          conferences include NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ISMRM, OHBM, IEEEVis and
          RSNA.
          <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis teaches intro to neuroengineering (ENGR-E 506) and
          image processing (ENGR-E 435/535, CSCI-B 456) (an advanced signal
          processing class). Prof. Garyfallidis is a core member of IUNI (IU
          Network Science Institute) and directs a new project for visualizing
          and interacting with large dynamic networks.
          <br /><br />

          Postdoctoral researcher with Prof. Maxime Descoteaux, inventor of
          analytical QBall, at the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (SCIL) of
          the University of Sherbrooke, CA.
          <br /><br />
          Prof. Garyfallidis has 20 years of experience in collaborating and
          supporting the research and day to day practice of psychiatrists,
          psychologists, neuroanatomists, neurosurgeons and ophthalmologists
          (dMRI, EEG, MEG, fMRI, OCT). Finally, Prof. Garyfallidis innovations
          and software are used by leading engineering companies such as IBM
