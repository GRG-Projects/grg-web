          The Garyfallidis Research Group (GRG) was established on September 1,
          2016, by Dr. Eleftherios Garyfallidis. GRG specializes in cutting-edge
          research across multiple domains, including medical imaging, machine
          learning, signal processing, scientific visualization, and software
          engineering. The groupâ€™s primary focus is the development of
          innovative methods in these areas, particularly for the analysis of
          MRI data. This research has broad applications, such as mapping the
          brain's structural connectivity, as well as targeted uses in fields
          like Alzheimer's disease research and brain tumor tracking. GRG also
          serves as the headquarters for DIPY, a renowned international software
          project dedicated to computational neuroanatomy. DIPY is widely
          recognized for its contributions to the field, offering advanced tools
          for understanding brain structure and function through imaging
          technologies.
